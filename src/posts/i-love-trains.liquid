        Railways originated in Germany in the 1550s; however, the first steam locomotives came from Great Britain at the dawn of the 19th century. They were initially intended to haul coal but were soon adapted to hold passengers.<a href="#s1"><sup>1</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Locomotives soon followed in the US in the 1820s. After the Civil War came the "Gilded Age" of rapid industrialization and technological innovation, which lasted from the 1880s to the 1920s. Mass steel manufacturing led to more robust rails and train wheels, compared to the original use of wood. Smaller wheels were developed for use on heavy duty freight trains, and larger wheels were used for faster passenger trains.<a href="#s1"><sup>1</sup></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        With the "Gilded Age" came the rise of infamous robber barons, such as Cornelius Vanderbilt and Andrew Carnegie, known for subjugating their workers to horrible conditions through intimidation, retaliation, and fraud. One prominant case of workers' rights abuses came from the 1892 Homestead Strike, in response to Carnegie Steel Co. breaking the Amalgamated Association's union contract with severe wage cuts. The company put a violent end to the strike, with around a dozen dead workers, as well as the dissolution of the Amalgamated Association through the aid of 8,500 National Guards.<a href="#s2"><sup>2</sup></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Rate discrimination was also a major issue, where railroads favored larger shippers over smaller businesses.<a href="#s3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Farmers, who were the main critics of rate discrimination, formed the National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry in 1867 in order to pressure state legislatures to regulate railroad freight rates. Consequently, some midwstern states agreed with their demands, and the US Interstate Commerce Commission was created in 1887 to look into rate structures.<a href="#s3"><sup>3</sup></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Racial discrimination was rampant among railroad industries as well. An estimated 15-20 thousand Chinese migrants laid the tracks of the western portion of the Transcontinental Railroad. They were often paid less than white workers, and hundreds died as a result of the dangerous conditions.<a href="#s4"><sup>4</sup></a> The history of black workers' contributions to the railroad industries have been poorly documented, but it is widely known that before the Civil War, nearly every railroad in the American South was built using slave labor. Black workers also played a crucial role in the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad, but were often faced with exploitative working conditions.<a href="#s5"><sup>5</sup></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        With the invention of cars and planes in the early 20th century came the demise of the railroad as the primary means of transportation in the US (often through corrupt means, but that is a whole other can of worms). However, many other countries have continued drastically improving train technology. In 1912 Switzerland came the world's first diesel locomotive, which was much more efficient than steam locomotives. In 1953, Japan set the narrow gauge world speed record of 145 km/h (90 mph). More currently, the Eurostar, founded in 1994, cut the travel time from London to Paris to only two hours. Many countries, such as Germany, China, and Japan, are pioneering maglev trains with super-conducting technology to further minimize resistance through magnetic levitation.

        I went on a long-winded tangent on the darker aspects of the railroad and train history; I feel that not acknowledging them would be somewhat disingenuous if I'm going to talk about how much I like them. One of my friends pointed out how, ironically, the train industry is currently among the more ethical transporation industries; it is proven that more trains will drastically improve the lives of millions of Americans, especially in more urban areas, yet the automobile industry has such a chokehold on legislatures that any more funding for more robust public transporation has been squandered. We all know about Boeing whistleblowers who mysteriously disappeared after speaking out about safety concerns. We continue seeing the US lag further and further behind other countries in terms of public transportation accessibility. I hope that before I die that there is a high-speed transcontinental railroad in the US, but built with ethical working conditions.

        Anyway, now let's learn about different types of trains and how they work!

        According to Start Pac, there are three primary types of locomotive engines: steam, diesel, and electric.<a href="#s6"><sup>6</sup></a>
