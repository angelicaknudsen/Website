        Railways originated in Germany in the 1550s; however, the first steam locomotives came from Great Britain at the dawn of the 19th century. They were initially intended to haul coal but were soon adapted to hold passengers.<a href="#s1"><sup>1</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Locomotives soon followed in the US in the 1820s. After the Civil War came the "Gilded Age" of rapid industrialization and technological innovation, which lasted from the 1880s to the 1920s. Mass steel manufacturing led to more robust rails and train wheels, compared to the original use of wood. Smaller wheels were developed for use on heavy duty freight trains, and larger wheels were used for faster passenger trains.<a href="#s1"><sup>1</sup></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        With the "Gilded Age" came the rise of infamous robber barons, such as Cornelius Vanderbilt and Andrew Carnegie, known for subjugating their workers to horrible conditions through intimidation, retaliation, and fraud. One prominant case of workers' rights abuses came from the 1892 Homestead Strike, in response to Carnegie Steel Co. breaking the Amalgamated Association's union contract with severe wage cuts. The company put a violent end to the strike, with around a dozen dead workers, as well as the dissolution of the Amalgamated Association through the aid of 8,500 National Guards.<a href="#s2"><sup>2</sup></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Rate discrimination was also a major issue, where railroads favored larger shippers over smaller businesses.<a href="#s3"><sup>3</sup></a> Farmers, who were the main critics of rate discrimination, formed the National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry in 1867 in order to pressure state legislatures to regulate railroad freight rates. Consequently, some midwestern states agreed with their demands, and the US Interstate Commerce Commission was created in 1887 to look into rate structures.<a href="#s3"><sup>3</sup></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Racial discrimination was rampant among railroad industries as well. An estimated 15-20 thousand Chinese migrants laid the tracks of the western portion of the Transcontinental Railroad. They were often paid less than white workers, and hundreds died as a result of the dangerous work conditions.<a href="#s4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

    <p>In addition, the history of black workers' contributions to the railroad industries have been poorly acknowledged. It is widely known that before the Civil War, nearly every railroad in the American South was built using slave labor. Railroad companies also often sought black workers as a source of cheap labor and a means of keeping wages depressed during the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad.<a href="#s5"><sup>5</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a href="#s6"><sup>6</sup></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        During the late 19th century, railroad companies initiated a campaign against black workers with the formation of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firement and Enginemen and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, which were white craft brotherhoods. These unions excluded black workers from membership or relegated them to segregated locals and auxiliaries controlled by white locals, where black workers were often denied representation and promotion in shops where white helpers were employed.<a href="#s6"><sup>6</sup></a> By 1910, these craft brotherhoods won labor agreements that severely restricted the kinds of jobs black workers could hold and the numbers of skilled black workers. Black workers, in response, determined that forming their own unions would be the most effective way to protect their jobs and founded all-black unions by the early 20th century, one of them being the Association of Colored Railway Trainmen and Locomotive Firemen, formed in 1912.<a href="#s6"><sup>6</sup></a> Due to pressure from these unions, the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) was founded in 1941, and their hearings led to twenty railroads and several unions ordered to cease their discriminatory practices. However, President Roosevelt did not enforce the FEPC's orders, and many of the white craft unions refused to admit any wrongdoings.<a href="#s6"><sup>6</sup></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        With the invention of cars and planes in the early 20th century came the demise of the railroad as the primary means of transportation in the US (often through corrupt means, but that is a whole other can of worms). However, many other countries have continued drastically improving train technology. In 1912, Switzerland invented the world's first diesel locomotive, which was much more efficient than steam locomotives. In 1953, Japan set the narrow gauge world speed record of 145 km/h (90 mph). More currently, the Eurostar, founded in 1994, cut the travel time from London to Paris to only two hours. Many countries, such as Germany, China, and Japan, are pioneering maglev (magnetic levitation) trains with super-conducting magnets to further minimize resistance.

    <p>
        I went on a long-winded tangent on the darker aspects of the history behind the railroad and trains. I feel that not acknowledging them would be somewhat disingenuous if I'm going to talk about how much I like trains. I would like to specify that I like the mechanical innerworkings of trains and the positive impact that they would have on society if they were more widespread.
    </p>

    <p>One of my friends pointed out how ironic it is that the train industry is currently among the more ethical transporation industries; it is proven that more trains will drastically improve the lives of millions of Americans, especially in more urban areas, yet the automobile industry has such a chokehold on legislatures that any more funding for more robust public transporation has been squandered. We all know about Boeing whistleblowers who "mysteriously" disappeared after speaking out about safety concerns. We continue seeing the US lag further and further behind other countries in terms of public transportation accessibility. I hope that before I die that there is a high-speed transcontinental railroad in the US, but built with ethical work conditions.

        Anyway, now let's learn about different types of trains and how they work!

        According to Start Pac, there are three primary types of locomotive engines: steam, diesel, and electric.<a href="#s7"><sup>7</sup></a>
    </p>

    <h4 id="steam">
        Steam
    </h4>

    <p>
        The main components behind a steam engine are <a href="#s8"><sup>8</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a href="#s9"><sup>9</sup></a>:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Fire where coal burns</li>
        <li>Boiler full of water that the fire heats to create steam</li>
        <li>Cylinder and piston</li>
        <li>Valves that control steam input and output</li>
        <li>Series of rods and other mechanisms to turn wheels</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        The first steam engines were quite inefficient since they were single-action, which meant that the pistons were powered only half the time. Double-action pistons were better since they had steam powering the pistons during all parts of the cycle. Also, steam-powered locomotives usually had the pistons on either side of the train, but slightly out of phase, so that there was consistent power output.<a href="#s9"><sup>9</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <p>
        Now, really fun stuff: <b>cycles</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Steam engines primarily used the Rankine cycle, which has four main states. Shown below is the ideal Rankine cycle.
    </p>

    <table style="border-color: white;">
        <tr>
            <th>States</th>
            <th>Processes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>$s_{1 \rightarrow 2}$</td>
            <td>Isentropic compression</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>$s_{2 \rightarrow 3}$</td>
            <td>Isobaric heat transfer in boiler</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>$s_{3 \rightarrow 4}$</td>
            <td>Isentropic expansion</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>$s_{4 \rightarrow 1}$</td>
            <td>Isobaric heat transfer in condenser</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        Isentropic means that there is no change in entropy during the process, and isobaric means that the process maintains constant pressure.
