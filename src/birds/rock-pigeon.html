        Rock pigeons are one of my <i style="color:brown"><b>favorite</b></i> birds.

        As they walk, their heads bobble. So adorable.

        I find it disheartening how humans domesticated these birds and then just abandoned them. Whenever you see rock pigeons, don't treat them as vermin; they just want to be loved.

                I felt so lucky finding this beauty. This pigeon has partial leucism, which is a condition where the pigeon doesn't have full pigmentation. Many fancy breeds of pigeons were intentionally bred to only display leucistic traits.

                Notice something interesting about these? They're <span style="color: rgb(255, 157, 146)">reddish-brown</span>! This trait is recessive and quite rare from my experience.
            </p>

                I found these pigeons when I was visiting some students at Brown University, so I thought it was a happy coincidence.
