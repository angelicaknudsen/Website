        Ah yes, herring gulls, a classic bird.

        Most "seagulls" you've seen are likely herring gulls. They're everywhere, very identifiable, and big.

                I found these herring gulls while en route to Brown University to visit some friends there. The way each little water-separator-thing had just one gull was very funny to me.

                Also, I believe there is a ring-billed gull in the top-right corner of the top image.

                I found this herring gull at Revere Beach. Just chilling and eager to eat.
