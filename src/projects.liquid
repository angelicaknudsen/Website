    <p>
        Hummingbirds are unique in that their feathers boast two extraordinary properties simultaneously: superhydrophobicity
        and iridescence. Generally, iridescent feathers in birds are less hydrophobic than non-iridescent
        ones. However, hummingbirds’ iridescent feathers exhibit a special evolutionary trait: flattened and hollowed melanosomes,
        called platelets. Usually, melanosomes, which are the cells that provide brown pigment, exhibit either hollowness or
        flatness in birds. The co-presence of hollowness and flatness is extremely rare and, thus far, has only been described in
        African starlings, trogons, and hummingbirds. This trait, paired with the intricate structure of gorget (throat) feathers,
        characterized by microscopic barbes and barbules, is hypothesized to result in combined iridescence and superhydrophobicity.
        Water-repelling feathers present an evolutionary advantage for hummingbirds since raindrops can slide off their body, avoiding
        feathers getting soaked and heavy which would prove detrimental to the bird’s flying abilities. Iridescence allows birds to
        visually communicate with their species, signaling mates or rivals. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We propose to reveal the geometry of the hummingbird’s hierarchical feather structure and how it leads to combined
        superhydrophobicity and iridescence. Using this, we will build an experimental model system of a synthetic version of the
        gorget feather to see how different geometric parameters can affect the hydrophobicity of a material. This experimental model
        system could influence the design of future materials that need to be hydrophobic and iridescent, such as clothing.

        Hydrophobicity of Feather-Inspired, 3D-Printed, Polymeric Materials

        Semester-long class project for 2.671 (Instrumentation and Measurement)

    </p>

    <p>
        Abstract: Feathers can vary hydrophobicity through differences in their
        microstructure geometry. These microstructures, known as barbs and barbules,
        can be emulated through 3D-printed materials at an enlarged scale to probe how
        different parameters of feather-like ridges influence hydrophobicity. The design includes
        five three-millimeter-wide circular samples featuring barbule-like ridges with
        different widths and angles. To characterize hydrophobicity, a two-microliter drop of water
        is placed on a sample surface, and a goniometer measures the mean contact angle (MCA), where
        higher mean contact angles indicate greater hydrophobicity. Wider ridges decreased
        hydrophobicity quadratically, with a leading coefficient of (-2.37 ± 0.92)×10-3 º/µm^2, while
        steeper angles increased hydrophobicity linearly, with a slope of (7.0 ± 3.8)×10^(-1), which is
        consistent with the theory behind feather hydrophobicity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Below is a sample CAD of a 3mm wide circle with 60-micron-wide ridges and 120-micron-spaced ridges.
        This project aims to vary two geometric parameters: ridge width and ridge angles.

        The top view illustrates the width of the ridges. The side view illustrates the angles
        of the ridges.

        Scrappy Yarn Winder
    </h2>

        Timeline: 1 week in Aug 2024
    </p>

    <p>
        Prototype entirely made out of scavenged parts (total budget: $0). The many crochet and knit
        projects that I abandoned motivated me to build this, as I wanted to speed up the process of frogging (frog meaning "rip it, rip it") them. I used scrap 1/8th inch acrylic and plywood from
        the Edgerton Center Student Project Lab to laser cut the gears and base (designed using Fusion 360), and I scavenged for all the other parts, including an empty spool from my work for the bent winding part and
        a brushed DC motor found in the EE lab of my dorm's basement. A 9V battery powers the winder, and I soldered the entire circuit (except for wires attached to motor so that I can take base apart), which includes a double pole switch
        for bidirectional movement of the motor. I also designed the yarn feeder and angle of the winder to be entirely customizable, with just a few
        bolts and wingnuts, for adjustability and possibility for different winder attachments, which is something that I noticed lacking
        in most commercial yarn winders.

    <p>
        I hope to build a more robust one that can withstand more weight and is more automated.

        Proof of concept part of the class 2.00A (Designing for the Future: Earth, Sea, and Space). Aim of design
        was to optimize water collection for marine research. Worked with other students to design a
        modular system with detachable test tubes and a peristaltic pump that turns and dispenses water from
        flexible tube. I was largely in charge of laser cutting, CAD-ing, and 3D-printing parts.
