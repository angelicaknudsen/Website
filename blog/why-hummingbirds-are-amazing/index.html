                1. Hummingbirds can hover
            </h3>

            <div class="blog-text">
                <p>
                    Hummingbirds have very special shoulder joints that enable their wings to
                    flap in a figure-eight pattern. This unique ability allows hummingbirds to generate
                    lift from their wings during every point of their flight cycle.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hummingbirds also don't have a preference for direction of flight. To put this in perspective:
                    we humans generally prefer moving forwards or backwards, and our brain is wired to favor this movement.
                    Hummingbirds don't have this preference; they are largely prey birds, and with wings
                    that are optimized for hovering, they must move in any direction at a moment's notice.

                2. Hummingbird feathers are simultaneously iridescent and hydrophobic
            </h3>

            <div class="blog-text">
                <p>
                    Specifically, the gorget (iridescent throat) feathers of the male hummingbirds
                    are known to exhibit simultaneous iridescence and hydrophobicity. This trait is incredibly
                    rare since these two properties have conflicting attributes: surface area exposure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Feathers come with a wide variety of microstructures, but they generally are oriented in a way to maximize hydrophobicity. This is due to water's cohesiveness; it tends to bind to every surface
                    it can grab a hold of, and soaked feathers can prove detrimental to a bird's flying capabilities and heat regulation. This is why feathers, especially among aquatic species, tend to have microstructures
                    that minimize surface area exposure, but not so small such that it would lose structural integrity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Iridescent feathers, on the other hand, tend to do the exact opposite, maximizing surface area exposure
                    in a way to defract more light. Brighter iridescence serves a communicative purpose,
                    with brighter feathers signaling a healthier mate. Many species may place these iridescent feathers in less key areas,
                    such as with male mallards having theirs on their head or as secondary wing feathers, where improvement in communication outweighs
                    the cost of hydrophilicity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, how do hummingbirds manage to have simultaneous hydrophobicity and iridescence? I am currently researching this phenomenon through my SuperUROP,
                    found <a href="/projects/#SuperUROP-anchor">here</a>.
