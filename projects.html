        <h3>
            Scrappy Yarn Winder
        </h3>
        <p>
            Timeline: 1 week in August 2024
        </p>

        <p>
            Prototype entirely made out of scavenged parts (total budget: $0). The many crochet and knit
            projects that I abandoned motivated me to build this, as I wanted to speed up the process of frogging (frog meaning "rip it, rip it") them. I used scrap 1/8th inch acrylic and plywood from
            the Edgerton Center Student Project Lab to laser cut the gears and base (designed using Fusion 360), and I scavenged for all the other parts, including an empty spool from my work for the bent winding part and
            a brushed DC motor found in the EE lab of my dorm's basement. A 9V battery powers the winder, and I soldered the entire circuit (except for wires attached to motor so that I can take base apart), which includes a double pole switch
            for bidirectional movement of the motor. I also designed the yarn feeder and angle of the winder to be entirely customizable, with just a few
            bolts and wingnuts, for adjustability and possibility for different winder attachments, which is something that I noticed lacking
            in most commercial yarn winders.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hope to build a more robust one that can withstand more weight and is more automated.

            Modular Water Collection Box
        </h3>
        <p>
            Timeline: April-May 2023
        </p>
        <p>
            Proof of concept part of the class 2.00A (Designing for the Future: Earth, Sea, and Space). Aim of design
            was to optimize water collection for marine research. Worked with other students to design a
            modular system with detachable test tubes and a peristaltic pump that turns and dispenses water from
            flexible tube. I was largely in charge of laser cutting, CAD-ing, and 3D-printing parts.

        <p>
            Part of project by MIT Robotics Team for a showcase. I designed a hinging hook mechanism that smoothly glides
            over and snaps onto rungs of ladder using rubber bands.

        <p>Timeline: January 2024-Present</p>
        <p>
            Passion project that I will build with my friends for my dorm, Random Hall. I'm in charge of designing,
            CAD-ing, and machining for the most part.

            Data Processor and Grapher for Marine Research
        </h3>

        <p>
            Timeline: Jun-July 2023
        </p>

        <p>
            Program part of my undergraduate research in coastal acidification during summer of 2023. Designed to process and graph data from the Hanna, Manta +35, and YSI CastAway sensors. Using the Python library matplotlib, I 
            converted files to .csv when needed, cleaned the data, and then graphed it on an interactive
            interface where when you click the window, it cycles through different parameters.
            Program is meant to be ran through command line interface.

            Personal Jeopardy Game (for fun lol)
        </h3>
        <p>Timeline: March-May 2020</p>
        <p>
            Passion project where I used Visual Basic .net to make an individual Jeopardy game. Structured like Jeopardy but more like
            a trivia game where you enter your answer under a 30-second time constraint.
