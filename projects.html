            Modular Water Collection Box
        </h3>
        <p>
            Timeline: April-May 2023
        </p>
        <p>
            Proof of concept part of the class 2.00A (Designing for the Future: Earth, Sea, and Space). Aim of design
            was to optimize water collection for marine research. Worked with other students to design a
            modular system with detachable test tubes and a peristaltic pump that turns and dispenses water from
            flexible tube. I was largely in charge of laser cutting, CAD-ing, and 3D-printing parts.
