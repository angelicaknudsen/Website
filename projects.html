            Modular Water Collection Box
        </h3>
        <p>
            Timeline: April-May 2023
        </p>
        <p>
            Proof of concept part of the class 2.00A (Designing for the Future: Earth, Sea, and Space). Aim of design
            was to optimize water collection for marine research. Worked with other students to design a
            modular system with detachable test tubes and a peristaltic pump that turns and dispenses water from
            flexible tube. I was largely in charge of laser cutting, CAD-ing, and 3D-printing parts.

            Part of project by MIT Robotics Team for a showcase. Primarily in charge of designing and building the
            sliding hooks that snap onto ladder rungs with assistance of rubber bands.

        <p>Timeline: January 2024-Present</p>
        <p>
            Passion project that I will build with my friends for my dorm, Random Hall. I'm in charge of designing,
            CAD-ing, and machining for the most part.

            Data Processor and Grapher for Marine Research
        </h3>

        <p>
            Timeline: Jun-July 2023
        </p>

        <p>
            Program part of my undergraduate research in coastal acidification during summer of 2023. Designed to process and graph data from the Hanna, Manta +35, and YSI CastAway sensors. Using the Python library matplotlib, I 
            converted files to .csv when needed, cleaned the data, and then graphed it on an interactive
            interface where when you click the window, it cycles through different parameters.
            Program is meant to be ran through command line interface.

            Personal Jeopardy Game (for fun lol)
        </h3>
        <p>Timeline: March-May 2020</p>
        <p>
            Passion project where I used Visual Basic .net to make an individual Jeopardy game. Structured like Jeopardy but more like
            a trivia game where you enter your answer under a 30-second time constraint.
        </p>

        <p>*Bug: the highest percent correct doesn't show up correctly for some reason.</p>
